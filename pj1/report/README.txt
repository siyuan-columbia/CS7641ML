Code link:
https://github.com/siyuan-columbia/CS7641ML/blob/main/pj1/code/pj1.py
Wine quality dataset:
https://github.com/siyuan-columbia/CS7641ML/blob/main/pj1/data/winequality-white.csv
Italian Mortgage Default Dataset:
https://github.com/siyuan-columbia/CS7641ML/blob/main/pj1/data/Italy_default_prior_2004.csv

The packages that need to install:
pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, datetime, numpy
Before running the code, please make sure the working directory has the following paths:
/data/winequality-white.csv
/data/Italy_default_prior_2004.csv
/result/decision_tree
/result/neural_network
/result/boosting
/result/SVM
/result/knn

To reduce the running time of my code, I specify my code to run only one algorithm on one dataset each time.
Please specify the dataset and algorithm by assigning correct number to dataset_num and algo_num in code line 19-20. Detailed mapping was specified in the code

After the above step, just hit run and all result will be saved in corresponding folder. No printed value is needed for analysis report.
