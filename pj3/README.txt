The package required to run my code in contained in https://github.com/siyuan-columbia/CS7641ML/blob/main/pj3/requirements.txt

In order to have an easier access to direct section, I added a switch on line 58-59 so that we can specify which dataset and process we want to run.

For dataset, we can select from iris, wine, default
For process, we can select 'clustering','PCA', 'ICA', 'Randomized projection', 'Forward stepwise', 'NN+PCA', 'NN+clustering'

After entering the specification, simply run the script and corresponding result will pop up in the result folder or print in the python console
